            <p>Two semesters have gone by, wow does time fly. I don't know exactly where you are at in within your school career, but from what I have researched and seen through a bit of stalking (sorry), you are at the fnish line. I am so immensely proud of you. I admire the ambition and dedication you have put into completing the program and all things before. Soon you will be putting everything you've learned into practice. You have come so far and I am so happy for you. I believe you are going to continue doing amazing things and that it is only up from here. I am rooting for you every step of the way. SO proud of you Lilly.</p>
